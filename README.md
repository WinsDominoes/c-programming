# Learning C!
Hey there! Welcome to this Github Repository. This is where I store my projects and programs that are related in to C programming. 

## Purpose? 
The purpose of this is to document my journey of learning the C programming language, I have already wanted to learn C but I haven't learned it seriously.

## Questions
Here are some questions regarding this repo. 

### Where's the old repo?
To you guys to followed me for a looong time, there used to be this repo called the "c-programming-language-book". At that time, I made it because I was mainly using a book written by the people who created C, "The C programming language, Second Edition". But then I used other resources such as books and sites to help me learn this programming language, so I decided to put everything in one place so it would be a lot more organizable and clean. You can still see it in the "the-c-programming-language-book" directory.
